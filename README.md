# AI-Based-Malware-Detection

This beginner-friendly project focuses on using AI to detect whether a file is malicious or benign based on basic file attributes. The project uses a simple machine learning model trained on file metadata to classify files as malware or safe.

## Project Overview

Malware is a constant threat in the cybersecurity world. This project leverages machine learning to detect malware based on features like file size, file type, and other metadata. You don’t need prior AI knowledge to follow along!

### Objectives:
- Preprocess malware data
- Train a basic machine learning model to classify files as malware or benign
- Evaluate the model's performance

## Dataset

For this project, we will be using a dataset from Kaggle. You can find the **Microsoft Malware Classification dataset** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data).

**Note:** You'll need to sign up for a Kaggle account to download the dataset.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Familiarity with Python basics
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts (optional)

### Libraries:
The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-malware-detection.git
   cd ai-malware-detection
   ```

2. **Download the dataset**:
   - Visit the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data) and download the dataset.
   - Extract the dataset into a folder named `data` in the root directory of this project.

3. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Use the script `preprocess_data.py` to clean the data, extract relevant features, and prepare it for training.

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Run `train_model.py` to train the malware detection model on the preprocessed data.

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the provided script.

   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

6. **Visualize Results**:
   - Optionally, visualize the accuracy and other performance metrics using the `visualize_results.py` script.

   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```

## How the Project Works

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - In the `preprocess_data.py` script, we clean and extract relevant file features such as file size, entropy, and file type.

2. **Training**:
   - In `train_model.py`, we train a simple **Random Forest** classifier on the features extracted during preprocessing.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to ensure its effectiveness in detecting malware.
